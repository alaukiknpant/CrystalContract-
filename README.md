# CrystalContract- Work contracts for the most vulnerable on the blockchain

CrystalContract is a DApp that runs on top of the Ethereum network. The purpose of CrystalContract is simple. We help employers and employees sign job contracts on the blockchain. Our target audience is primarily composed of construction and hospitality companies in the Gulf region and the low-skilled migrant workers they hire.

Contracts signed using CrystalContract legally require both parties to act in good faith just like a traditional job contract. Crystalcontract is different because it is in the blockchain and cannot be changed, deleted or intransparent. We will get to the benefits of using blockchain later.

1. Here is how it works:

a. Registered companies seeking to hire workers from abroad are able to request access to our network. (permissioned)
b. Workers seeking to go abroad can also join the network at the cost of a small gas fee g.
c. Recruiting companies can also join the network at a fee costing x dollars.
d. Workers and companies can sign a work contract on the network. The contract is composed of information including but not limited to the duration, salary, start date, job description and any other relevant information. Recruiting companies that helped the two parties sign the contract are also mentioned in the job contract.
e. Workers that signed a contract with the company at some point can register complaints about the company. Others who have signed a contract with the same company can also show support by signing the report digitally..


2. The problems it solves:

i) It helps a third parties such as airport officials monitor human trafficking by checking weather there is a contract between the comapany and the employee. 
ii) A third party such as the government can remotely monitor if all contracts guarantee at least minimum wage to the workers.
iii) It gives a voice to the most vulnerable through a complaint platform. 
iv) It eliminates middlemen that have traditionally supplied fake paperwork to workers. It also helps track all the contracts that a mediator helped to sign, making the mediator more responsible in sending people to  companies with good practices and accountable for any fees they charge to broker the contract.

3. Use of Blockchain Technology

CrystalContract’s blockchain solution is better than a massive government database software because the foriegn labor market is corrupt. For instance, former president of the Nepal football Association Ganesh Thapa was found linked to Qatari government. In 2014, one Nepalese migrant worker died every two days building the 2022 World Cup stadiums in Qatar. We need a technology that is immutable and can also possibly be accessed by multiple parties such as Amnesty International or the United Nations Human Rights Council.

4. Why use the Ethereum’s blockchain development environment? 

The only options to build a smart contract that uses blockchain technology that we know of are ethereum, building your own blockchain, or using a centralised network like hyper ledger. In our case, using a centralised network would make it easier for a company to bribe a report out of existence. Building our own blockchain would be difficult, and we would struggle with adoption incentives for miners. Because this project is rather simple in scope, the best solution was to build it on top of the Ethereum blockchain.
